# Week4 exercise2

On the Logout page that you created in the previous exercise, you should now also clear the information that lives in the Context.

When the Logout page mounts, call a function that sets the `user` in the Context equal to `false`.

The main trick of the exercise is to figure out how can you call a function from the Context inside the Logout page.
Hint: Use the knowledge you gained in lab 3 :)

### PART I

The form on the Account page is at the moment taking in static data from mocks.js.

We would like pass dynamic data to it so that the form can build itself based on the type of account that is currenlty logged in.
The data should come from the user object stored in the Context.

### PART II

At the moment, on submit, the `Account` form just logs the values.

Create a new request function that sends the data to the `edit candidate endpoint`.
The endpoint for the editCandidate is:
`https://match-labs-api.herokuapp.com/api/candidates/:id`

Make sure the method you are using is `PUT`.

When clicking on `Submit`, the Account form should send the data to the API and edit the current user.
